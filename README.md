# hello-world This is gong to be interesting, popcorn may be needed
I'm ready to push myself to learn something new again. 
I'm becoming rather bored in my field of logistics and am ready to see how far I can push myself in the area of coding and maybe even become good at it. 
I have previously been blessed with amazing skills such as breaking the computer and was, for a period a regular visitor at the blue screen of 'WTF is that?/Aww gosh not you again!' After a few too many vistis to youtube searching for fast fixes and backslashing till the cows came home before sheepishly handing the computer over to a professional. I figure I should maybe learn what I'm doing and pick up a few coding skills along the way, possibly even a new career in coding... Feel free to prompt me if you see I'm about to break the internet or have any other advice it's all welcome.

First ever hit push. I think I thought GitHub was more of a blog back then, if me back then can see me right now. You'll be amazed at what you'll learn. So much more greatness to come.
